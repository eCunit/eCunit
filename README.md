======

Testing framework for embedded C

eCunit is supposed to become a TDD enabling testing framework for embedded C developers.

* Its automation features are inspired by Junit4.
* To enable test driven development, we add automocking features.
* For general testing we add logging features.

The project will be developed in JAVA using TDD.
